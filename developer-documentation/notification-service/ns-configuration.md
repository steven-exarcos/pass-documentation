# Notification Services - Configuration

The required runtime configuration for Notification Services (NS) is composed of a configuration file and a set of environment variables.

## Configuration File
The NS configuration file is referenced by the environment variable `PASS_NOTIFICATION_CONFIGURATION` or a system property 
named `pass.notification.configuration`. The value of this environment variable must be a Spring Resource URI, beginning 
with classpath:/, file:/, or http://.

Here is a sample NS configuration file:

```json
{
  "mode": "${pass.notification.mode}",
  "recipient-config": [
    {
      "mode": "DEMO",
      "fromAddress": "demo-pass@mail.local.domain",
      "global_cc": [
        "demo@mail.local.domain"
      ],
      "whitelist": [
        "mailto:emetsger@mail.local.domain"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "templates": [
    {
      "notification": "SUBMISSION_APPROVAL_INVITE",
      "templates": {
        "SUBJECT": "Approval Invite Subject",
        "BODY": "Approval Invite Body",
        "FOOTER": "classpath:/templates/footer.hbr"
      }
    },
    {
      "notification": "SUBMISSION_APPROVAL_REQUESTED",
      "templates": {
        "SUBJECT": "Approval Requested Subject",
        "BODY": "Approval Requested Body",
        "FOOTER": "classpath:/templates/footer.hbr"
      }
    },
    {
      "notification": "SUBMISSION_CHANGES_REQUESTED",
      "templates": {
        "SUBJECT": "Changes Requested Subject",
        "BODY": "Changes Requested Body",
        "FOOTER": "classpath:/templates/footer.hbr"
      }
    },
    {
      "notification": "SUBMISSION_SUBMISSION_SUBMITTED",
      "templates": {
        "SUBJECT": "Submission Submitted Subject",
        "BODY": "Submission Submitted Body",
        "FOOTER": "classpath:/templates/footer.hbr"
      }
    },
    {
      "notification": "SUBMISSION_SUBMISSION_CANCELLED",
      "templates": {
        "SUBJECT": "Submission Cancelled Subject",
        "BODY": "Submission Cancelled Body",
        "FOOTER": "classpath:/templates/footer.hbr"
      }
    }
  ],
  "link-validators": [
    {
      "rels" : [
        "submission-view",
        "submission-review",
        "submission-review-invite"
      ],
      "requiredBaseURI" : "https://example.org",
      "throwExceptionWhenInvalid": true
    }, 
    {
      "rels": ["*"],
      "requiredBaseURI" : "http",
      "throwExceptionWhenInvalid": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Mode

Notification Services (NS) has three runtime modes:
- `DISABLED`: No notifications will be composed or emitted.  All JMS messages received by NS will be immediately acknowledged and subsequently discarded.
- `DEMO`: Allows a whitelist, global carbon copy recipient list, and notification templates to be configured distinct from the `PRODUCTION` mode.  Otherwise exactly the same as `PRODUCTION`.
- `PRODUCTION`: Allows a whitelist, global carbon copy recipient list, and notification templates to be configured distinct from the `DEMO` mode.  Otherwise exactly the same as `DEMO`.

Configuration elements for both `PRODUCTION` and `DEMO` modes may reside in the same configuration file.  There is no need to have separate configuration files for a "demo" and "production" instance of NS.

The environment variable `PASS_NOTIFICATION_MODE` (or its system property equivalent `pass.notification.mode`) is used to set the runtime mode.

## Notification Recipients

The recipient(s) of a notification (e.g. email) is a function of a `{Submission, SubmissionEvent}` tuple.  After the recipient list has been determined, it can be manipulated as discussed below.

### Whitelist

Each configuration mode (discussed above) may have an associated whitelist.  If the whitelist is empty, _all_ recipients for a given notification will receive an email.  If the whitelist is _not empty_, the recipients for a given notification will be filtered, and _only_ whitelisted recipients will receive the notification.  Having a whitelist for the `DEMO` mode is useful to prevent accidental spamming of end users with test notifications.

Production should use an empty whitelist (i.e. all potential notification recipients are whitelisted).

### Global Carbon Copy Support

Each configuration mode (discussed above) may specify one or more "global carbon copy" addresses.  These addresses will receive a copy of each email sent by Notification Services (NS).  Global carbon copy addresses are implicitly whitelisted; they do not need to be explicitly configured in a whitelist.

Blind carbon copy is also supported.

Here is an example recipient configuration that specifies a global carbon copy and a global blind carbon copy:

```json
"recipient-config": [
    {
      "mode": "DEMO",
      "fromAddress": "pass-noreply@jhu.edu",
      "global_cc": [
        "pass-support@jhu.edu"
      ],
      "global_bcc": [
        "pass-ops@jhu.edu"
      ]          
    }
]
```

Multiple email addresses may be specified.

### Example

For example, let's say that NS is preparing to send a notification to `user@example.org`.

If the runtime mode of NS is `DEMO`, and:
- the `DEMO` mode has no (or an empty) whitelist, then `user@example.org` and the global carbon copy address (for the `DEMO` mode) receives the notification.
- the `DEMO` mode has a whitelist that does _not_ contain `user@example.org`, then only the global carbon copy address receives the notification
- the `DEMO` mode has a whitelist that _does contain_ `user@example.org`, then `user@example.org` and the global carbon copy address receives the notification
- the `DEMO` mode has a whitelist that does _not_ contain `user@example.org` and there is no global carbon copy address (for the `DEMO` mode), then no notification will be dispatched

If the runtime mode of NS is `PRODUCTION`, and:
- the `PRODUCTION` mode has no (or an empty) whitelist, then `user@example.org` and the global carbon copy address (for the `PRODUCTION` mode) receives the notification.
- the `PRODUCTION` mode has a whitelist that does _not_ contain `user@example.org`, then only the global carbon copy address receives the notification
- the `PRODUCTION` mode has a whitelist that _does contain_ `user@example.org`, then `user@example.org` and the global carbon copy address receives the notification
- the `PRODUCTION` mode has a whitelist that does _not_ contain `user@example.org` and there is no global carbon copy address (for the `PRODUCTION` mode), then no notification will be dispatched

## Environment Variables

Supported environment variables (system property analogs) and default values are:

- `PASS_NOTIFICATION_QUEUE_EVENT_NAME` (`pass.notification.queue.event.name`): `event`
- `PASS_NOTIFICATION_MODE` (`pass.notification.mode`): `DEMO`
- `PASS_CLIENT_URL` (`pass.client.url`): `{PASS_CLIENT_URL:localhost:8080}`
- `PASS_CLIENT_USER` (`pass.client.user`): `{PASS_CLIENT_USER:fakeuser}`
- `PASS_CLIENT_PASSWORD` (`pass.client.password`): `${PASS_CLIENT_PASSWORD:fakepassword}`
- `SPRING_MAIL_HOST` (`spring.mail.host`): `${SPRING_MAIL_HOST:localhost}`
- `SPRING_MAIL_PORT` (`spring.mail.port`): `${SPRING_MAIL_PORT:587}`
- `SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME` (`spring.mail.user`): `{SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME}`
- `SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD` (`spring.mail.pass`): `{SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD}`
- `SPRING_MAIL_PROTOCOL` (`spring.mail.transport`): `${SPRING_MAIL_PROTOCOL:SMTP}`
- `PASS_NOTIFICATION_CONFIGURATION` (`pass.notification.configuration`): `classpath:/notification.json`

In order for notification services to connect to AWS SQS queue (the default messaging provider), the following variables must be set:

As Environment Variables (System Properties (-Dargs)):

- `AWS_REGION` (`aws.region`): AWS region id (i.e. `us-east-1`)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (`aws.accessKeyId`): AWS Access Key to account with access to SQS queue
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (`aws.secretKey`) : AWS Secret Access Key to account with access to SQS queue
