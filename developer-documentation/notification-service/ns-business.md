# Notification Services - Business Logic

The following is a list of the components responsible for notification business logic implementation.

## SubmissionEventListener
The `SubmissionEventListener` is the component responsible for connecting to a messaging source and reading 
SubmissionEventMessage messages.  Note the use of the Spring annotation JmsListener on the processMessage message.  NS 
uses Spring for messaging configuration.

The NS responds asynchronously to modification of `SubmissionEvent` resources. A `SubmissionEvent` represents the state of 
the `Submission` in a workflow. Each time a significant step in the submission workflow is taken, a `SubmissionEvent`
resource will be created.  Notification Services do not create `SubmissionEvent` resources; `SubmissionEvent`
resources are created by Ember via Pass-Core as the user moves through the submission workflow.  Pass-Core will emit 
a `SubmissionEventMessage` message indicating the creation of the `SubmissionEvent`, and the Notification Service will 
listen for, and respond to these messages.

## NotificationService
The `NotificationService` is the primary service that contains the business logic associated with reading the `Submission`
for the `SubmissionEventMessage` and composing a Notification and handing it off for dispatch. If future requirements 
dictate multiple Notifications were to arise from a single `SubmissionEvent`, `NotificationService` would be the starting 
point for implementing the fan out.

## Composer
The `Composer` class does the heavy lifting within the `NotificationService`. It is responsible for composing a `Notification`
from the `Submission` and `SubmissionEvent`, including:

- determining the type of `Notification`
- creating and populating the data structures used in the parameters map
- invoking the LinkValidator to ensure the `SubmissionEvent` contains valid links for the `Notification` type
- determining the recipients of the `Notification`, and from whom the `Notification` should come from

After a Notification has been created and populated, it is sent to the DispatchService.

### Notification Links

Notifications which prompt the recipient to perform an action are to contain a "deep link", that when clicked/activated, 
takes the user directly to the web page in PASS that requires their attention.  For example, a "please review" deep link 
would resolve directly to the submission overview, with a button allowing the user to approve the submission, cancel the 
submission, or request further changes.  A notification that requests corrections should deep link to a page that 
highlights the edits or actions required by the user, displaying the comments or instructions from the reviewer.

Link in SubmissionEvent and SubmissionEventMessage for user token link.

#### Link Replay
Because deep links are durably stored (i.e. they can be found in email and used at any time after receipt), they may be 
replayed after the action has been taken.  For example, a user activates a "please review" notification link after they 
have already performed the review.  The user interface or link resolution components will respond in a graceful way when 
this occurs.

#### Link Security
If a user's permissions change between the time a link was generated and the time a link was activated - for example, a 
User was an Authorized Submitter at the time the link was generated, and they were removed from the Grant by the time 
the link was activated, the user interface or link resolution components will respond in a graceful way insuring the 
user cannot approve something they don't have permission for.

#### User Token Link

According to the proxy submitter use case, a preparer may request an authorized submitter review a submission without 
that submitter existing within PASS. 

In this case, a `SubmissionEventMessage` with an associated `SubmissionEvent` of type`APPROVAL_REQUESTED_NEWUSER` will 
be created by Pass-Core and sent to the message queue. The `SubmissionEventMessage` object will have the User Token
Link set in the `SubmissionEventMessage.userApprovalLink` attribute. This is the link that is included in the
notification for the recipient to click on so a User object is created for them to authorize the submission.

#### Link Validation

The class `LinkValidator` will use `link-validators` in the notification configuration to validate that the correct URL 
is present in the `Link` object for the `Notification` type.  The `Link` objects are created in the 
`SubmissionLinkAnalyzer` and then sent to `LinkValidator`.  The `link-validators` field in the notification 
configuration file can be an array of `Notification` types or `*` which will be a link validation rule that applies to 
all.
