# NIHMS Loader

The NIH Manuscript Submission Loader (NIHMS) contains the components required to download, transform and load Submission information from NIHMS to PASS. The project includes two command line tools. The first uses the NIH API to download the CSV(s) containing compliant, non-compliant, and in-process publication information. The second tool reads those files, transforms the data to the PASS data model and then loads them to PASS.

For background information on PACM, see the user guide. Limited information on using the PACM API can be found here.

### NIHMS Data Harvest CLI

The NIHMS Data Harvest CLI uses the NIH API to download the PACM data.
Pre-requisites

The following are required to run this tool:

    Java 8 or later
    Download the latest nihms-data-harvest-cli-exec.jar from the releases page and place in a folder on the machine where the application will run.
    Get an account for the NIH PACM website, and obtain an API key. The API key is only valid for 3 months, so it will need to be updated periodically.
    Create a data folder that files will be downloaded to.

Data Harvest Configuration

There are several ways to configure the Data Harvest CLI. Data Harvest CLI is a Spring Boot Application, so it can be configured as described here: Spring Boot Configuration

You will need to set values for the following props: nihmsetl.api.url.param.inst, nihmsetl.api.url.param.ipf, and nihmsetl.api.url.param.api-token. There are a number of ways to do this with a spring boot app that are described in the link above.

Here is an example using Java system properties -D.

> java -Dnihmsetl.api.url.param.inst=my-inst -Dnihmsetl.api.url.param.ipf=my-ipf -Dnihmsetl.api.url.param.api-token=my-token -jar nihms-data-harvest-cli-exec.jar

Running the Data Harvester

Once the Data Harvest CLI has been configured, there are a few additional options you can add when running from the command line.

By default all 3 publication statuses - compliant, non-compliant, and in-process CSVs will be downloaded. To download one or two of them, you can add them individually at the command line:

    -c, -compliant, --compliant - Download compliant publication CSV.
    -p, -inprocess, --inprocess - Download in-process publication CSV.
    -n, -noncompliant, --noncompliant - Download non-compliant publication CSV.

You can also specify a start date, by default the PACM system sets the start date to 1 year prior to the date of the download. You can change this by adding a start date parameter:

    -s, -startDate --startDate - This will return all records published since the date provided. The syntax is mm-yyyy .

So, for example, to download the compliant publications published since December 2012, you would do the following:

> java -jar nihms-data-harvest-cli-exec.jar -s 12-2012 -c

On running this command, files will be downloaded and renamed with a prefix according to their status ("compliant", " noncompliant", or "inprocess") and a timestamp integer e.g. noncompliant_nihmspubs_20180507104323.csv.
NIHMS Data Transform-Load CLI

The NIHMS Data Transform-Load CLI reads data in from CSVs that were downloaded from the PACM system, converts them to PASS compliant data and loads them into the PASS database.
Pre-requisites

The following is required to run this tool:

    Java 8 or later
    Download latest nihms-data-transform-load-cli-exec.jar from the releases page and place in a folder on the machine where the application will run.

Data Transform-Load Configuration

There are several ways to configure the Data Transform-Load CLI. Data Transform-Load CLI is a Spring Boot Application, so it can be configured as described here: Spring Boot Configuration

You will need to set values for the following props: nihmsetl.repository.id, pass.client.url, pass.client.user and pass.client.password. There are a number of ways to do this with a spring boot app that are described in the link above.

Here is an example using Java system properties -D.

> java -Dnihmsetl.repository.id=my-repo-id -Dpass.client.url=my-url -Dpass.client.user=my-user -Dpass.client.password=my-pw -jar nihms-data-transform-load-exec.jar

Running the Data Transform-Load

Once the Data Transform-Load CLI has been configured, there are a few additional options you can add when running from the command line.

By default all 3 publication statuses - compliant, non-compliant, and in-process CSVs will be downloaded. To download one or two of them, you can add them individually at the command line:

    -c, -compliant, --compliant - Download compliant publication CSV.
    -p, -inprocess, --inprocess - Download in-process publication CSV.
    -n, -noncompliant, --noncompliant - Download non-compliant publication CSV.

So, for example, to process non-compliant spreadsheets only:

> java -jar nihms-data-transform-load-cli-exec.jar -n

When run, each row will be loaded into the application and new Publications, Submissions, and RepositoryCopies will be created in PASS as needed. The application will also update any Deposit.repositoryCopy links where a new one is discovered. Once a CSV file has been processed, it will be renamed with a suffix of ".done" e.g. noncompliant_nihmspubs_20180507104323.csv.done. To re-process the file, simply rename it to remove the .done suffix and re-run the application.


## Next Step / Institution Configuration

Configuring the NIHMS loader to run at an institution requires several NIH/NLM accounts to be setup.
