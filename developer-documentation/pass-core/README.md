# Pass Core

## Summary

This module is a Spring Boot and Elide application which provides HTTP APIs.

PASS has a single page JavaScript user interface based on Ember. The UI interacts with pass-core through HTTP APIs.

The HTTP APIs are JSON:API for CRUD and search on the PASS data model, a custom file API to handle binaries, a custom DOI API, a custom metadata schema API, a custom user service API, and a custom policy service API. The pass-core component runs these APIs, handles authentication, sends messages to queues, and mediates access to static HTTP resources.

Several additional services run on the backend. [Data loaders](../data-loaders) periodically update PASS with the latest information about institutional grants, journal metadata, and PubMed central publications. A deposit service turns submissions to PASS into deposits to repositories like DSpace and PubMed Central. A notification service sends email to users about events. The deposit and notification services monitory message queues. The deposit service also polls PASS for objects it needs to update.

Elide provides a JSON:API based interface to the data model and persists the data model to a database. Both the UI and backend services interact with the data model using JSON:API.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Data Model

The [data model](./model/) holds all the information needed to associate users with grants and manage deposits to repositories.

### Building

Java 17, Maven 3.8, and Docker are required.

```shell
mvn clean install
```

This will produce an executabler jar `pass-core-main/target/pass-core-main-<release>-exec.jar` and a docker image `ghcr.io/eclipse-pass/pass-core-main`.

#### Running the local build

After you have run `mvn clean install`, execute the following command from the `pass-core-main` directory:

```shell
java -Dspring.config.import=file:./src/test/resources/application-test.yml -jar target/pass-core-main-<release>-exec.jar
```

This command will use the configuration defined in the `pass-core-main/src/test/resources/application-test.yml` file. **This configuration should not be used in production, it is only meant for testing purposes.**

You can verify it is running by making a request like:

```shell
curl -u backend:moo localhost:8080/data/grant
```

#### Running with Docker

Run `mvn clean install`. Then go to the [pass-docker](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/pass-docker) repository and following the instructions for starting a local environment.

### Configuration

The application is configured by its `pass-core-main/src/main/resources/application.yaml` which in turn references a number of environment variables.

By default, pass-core-main will run with a typical production configuration. In order to run the default configuration, the environment variables below must be set with appropriate values for your environment.

Environment variables:
| Environment Variable                             | Default Value                | Description                                                                                                             |

The liquibase changelog located `pass-core-main/src/main/resources/db/changelog/changelog.yaml` will create the pass-core database schema if needed.

If `PASS_CORE_USE_SQS` is `true`, then pass-core will attempt to connect to Amazon SQS. For testing purposes, you can set `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for connecting to AWS resources. In production, AWS IAM Service Roles should be used.

Otherwise, a connection to an ActiveMQ broker can be configured by setting `SPRING_ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_URL`. If `PASS_CORE_EMBED_JMS_BROKER` is true, then an embedded ActiveMQ broker will be started
using that url. This can be useful to set tcp transport for connecting containers in a docker environment. The default is an embedded broker using vm transport.

**Note you can quickly start pass-core locally for testing purposes following the instructions in [Running local build](#running-local-build) section.**

### Access control

SAML 2.0 and HTTP basic authentication are supported. An authenticated user is either authorized with a `BACKEND` or `SUBMITTER` role.

A user that does a SAML login is mapped to a PASS user using locator ids. The provided SAML properties of the user
are interpreted using the spring property `pass.auth.attribute-map`. The user is assigned the `SUBMITTER` role.

There is a single `BACKEND` user specified who logs in using HTTP basic.

The `BACKEND` role can do everything. The `SUBMITTER` role is restricted to creating and modifying certain objects in the data model.
The `SUBMITTER` has full access to all other services. 

Details are available in the [Authentication and Authorization section](authentication-authorization.md).

### SAML configuration

The `PASS_CORE_SP_KEY` and `PASS_CORE_SP_CERT` environment variables set the location of the keys used by pass-core to encrypt SAML communication.
Use `PASS_CORE_SP_ID` to set the identifier of the pass-core SP, `PASS_CORE_IDP_METADATA` to set the location where IDP metadata can be retrieved,
`PASS_CORE_SP_ACS` for the Assertion Consumer Service of the SP and `PASS_CORE_LOGIN_PROCESSING_PATH` to set the path for handling login from the IDP.
Note that `PASS_CORE_SP_ACS` is a URL which must match the path specified in `PASS_CORE_LOGIN_PROCESSING_PATH`.

The `application-test.yml` configuration is are set such that the integration tests can run against a [SimpleSAMLphp based IDP](https://github.com/kenchan0130/docker-simplesamlphp/) using resources included in `saml2/`. These defaults should not be used in production.

The image can be run with:

```shell
docker run --name=idp -p 8090:8080 -e SIMPLESAMLPHP_SP_ENTITY_ID=https://sp.pass/shibboleth -e SIMPLESAMLPHP_SP_ASSERTION_CONSUMER_SERVICE=http://localhost:8080/login/saml2/sso/pass -e SIMPLESAMLPHP_IDP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8090/   -v ./pass-core/pass-core/main/src/test/resources/saml2/authsources.php:/var/www/simplesamlphp/config/authsources.php -d kenchan0130/simplesamlphp
```

Note the volume mount which is set the user information appropriately for PASS.

### CSRF protection

Requests which have side effects (not a GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS and any request to /doi) are protected from CSRF through the use of a token. The client must provide a cookie XSRF-TOKEN and set a header X-XSRF-TOKEN to the same value. Clients can use any value they want. Browser clients will have the cookie value set by responses and so must first make a non-protected request.

### APIs 

#### App `/app/`

The PASS application is available at `/app/` and `/` is redirected to `/app/`. Requests are resolved against the location given by the environment variable `PASS_CORE_APP_LOCATION`. If a request cannot be resolved, then `/app/index.html` will be returned.  This allows the user interface to handle paths which may not resolve to files.

#### User `/user/`

The [user API](api/user.md) provides information about the logged in user.

#### DOI `/doi/`

The [DOI API](api/doi.md) provides the ability to interact with DOIs.

#### File `/file/`

The [file API](api/file.md) provides a mechanism to persist files.

#### Policy `/policy/`

The [policy API](api/policy.md) indicates what repositories are publication should be pushed to.

#### Metadata Schema

The [metadata schema API](api/metadata-schema.md) provides JSON schemas to describe PASS submission metadata.

#### JSON API

JSON API is deployed at the `/data/` endpoint. All of our data model is available, just divided into attributes and relationships. Note that identifiers are now integers, not URIs.
See the [Elide docs](https://elide.io/pages/guide/v6/10-jsonapi.html) for information on how Elide provides support for filtering and sorting.

See the `/swagger/` endpoint for auto-generated documentation.

You can directly make request with the UI and see what happens. Note when doing a POST to create an object, be sure to edit the type field to have the correct object type and delete the id field to have the id auto-generated.

### Examples

#### Creating a RepositoryCopy

```shell
curl -v -u backend:moo -H "X-XSRF-TOKEN:token" -H "Cookie:XSRF-TOKEN=token" -X POST "http://localhost:8080/data/repositoryCopy" -H "accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" -d @rc1.json
```

*rc1.json:*
```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "type": "repositoryCopy",
    "attributes": {
      "accessUrl": "http://example.com/path",
      "copyStatus": "accepted"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Patch a Journal

Add a publisher object to the publisher relationship in a journal. Note that both the journal and publisher objects must already exist.

```shell
curl -u backend:moo -H "X-XSRF-TOKEN:token" -H "Cookie:XSRF-TOKEN=token" -X PATCH "http://localhost:8080/data/journal/1" -H "accept: application/vnd.api+json" -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" -d @patch.json
```

*patch.json:*
 ```JSON
 {
  "data": {
    "type": "journal",
    "id": "1",
    "relationships": {
      "publisher": {
        "data": {
          "id": "2",
          "type": "publisher"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Messages

Messages are JSON objects emitted to a JMS broker as text messages. The different types of messages are sent to different queues specified
by the indicated by the environment variables `PASS_CORE_SUBMISSION_QUEUE`, `PASS_CORE_SUBMISSION_EVENT_QUEUE`, and `PASS_CORE_DEPOSIT_QUEUE`.

When a Submission is created or modified and the submitted field is true, then a SubmissionReady event is emitted.
The id of the Submission will be set in the `submission` field of the message.

When a SubmissionEvent is created, then the a SubmissionEvent message will be sent.
The id of the SubmissionEvent will be set in the `submission-event` field of the message. If the `eventType` field is `APPROVAL_REQUESTED_NEWUSER`,
then an `approval-link` field will be set in the field of the message with a link to be sent to a user.

When a Deposit is created or modified, then a DepositStatus event is emitted.
The id of the Deposit will be set in the `deposit` field of the message.

**Example messages:**

```JSON
{
    "type": "SubmissionReady",
    "submission": "1"
}
```
```JSON
{
    "type": "DepositStatus",
    "deposit": "1"
}
```
```JSON
{
    "type": "SubmissionEvent",
    "submission-event": "1",
    "approval-link": "http://example.com/passui?userToken=xxxx"
}
```

### Debugging problems

To get more information, try changing the logging levels set in `pass-core-main/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml`.
You might also try setting properties like `-Dlogging.level.org.eclipse.pass=DEBUG`.

The [Elide Docs](https://elide.io/pages/guide/v6/12-audit.html) provide more information on logging and debugging.

## Next Steps / Institution Configuration

### Environmental Variable Setup
PASS is designed to be flexible and can be easily configured using the environment variables in this section and the environment variables mentioned in the [API section](./api) as well.

Key variables to consider include:

* PASS Admin and URLs:

```text
PASS_CORE_BASE_URL=[your-base-url]
PASS_CORE_USER=[your-username]
PASS_CORE_PASSWORD=[your-password]
PASS_CORE_APP_LOCATION=[url-of-front-end]
```

* Database Configuration: Set up the database connection details for PostgreSQL:

```text
PASS_CORE_DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://[your-database-host]:5432/[database-name]
PASS_CORE_DATABASE_USERNAME=[your-username]
PASS_CORE_DATABASE_PASSWORD=[your-password]
```

* SAML Authentication: Provide the institution-specific values for SAML configurations:

```text
PASS_CORE_IDP_METADATA=classpath:saml2/[institution-idp-metadata].xml
PASS_CORE_SP_ID=https://[your-domain]/shibboleth
PASS_CORE_SP_CERT=classpath:saml2/[institution-sp-cert].pem
PASS_CORE_SP_KEY=classpath:saml2/[institution-sp-key].pem
PASS_CORE_SP_ACS=http://[your-domain]:8080/login/saml2/sso/pass
```

* AWS Configuration (if using SQS or S3):

```text
AWS_REGION=[aws-region]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[aws-access-key]
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[aws-secret-key]
PASS_CORE_USE_SQS=true

# If using S3 bucket for the file service
PASS_CORE_FILE_SERVICE_TYPE=S3
PASS_CORE_S3_BUCKET_NAME=[your-bucket-name]
PASS_CORE_S3_REPO_PREFIX=[your-prefix-name]
```

Review and adjust the other environment variables (e.g., queues, ports, CSP policies) as necessary to suit the institution's security and operational policies.

## Database Setup

If using a new PostgreSQL instance, ensure the schema is correctly initialized. The liquibase changelog `(src/main/resources/db/changelog/changelog.yaml)` will handle the schema setup automatically. Verify that:

* The schema is created correctly.
* Any institution-specific schema changes or extensions are applied.

## Custom Policy Configuration

Institutions may have specific deposit and submission policies. Configure these by following the instructions in the [Policy API section](./api/policy.md). This will ensure that the appropriate rules and repositories are applied based on your institutional guidelines.

## Institution-Specific Metadata Schema
If your institution has specific metadata requirements for submissions, you may need to customize the metadata schema using the instructions in the [Metadata Schema API section](./api/policy.md). This section will introduce you to the metadata schema and will assist in creating a metadata schema to match your institutional standards.
