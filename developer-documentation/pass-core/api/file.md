# File API

The file is a RESTful service that provides the ability to upload, download, and delete files to a configured 
persistence store. The service is currently designed to persist to a filesystem or S3 compatible storage.

## Configuration

The service is configured via environment variables. The service by default will use a filesystem based persistence 
store and does not require any additional configuration. If the variable `PASS_CORE_FILE_SERVICE_ROOT_DIR` does not have 
any value, the File Service will default to the system temp folder and create a temporary root folder of a random value 
in the system temp. The variable `PASS_CORE_FILE_SERVICE_ROOT_DIR` is used by both the `FILE_SYSTEM` and `S3` service types. 
It is the root directory where temporary files are stored before being persisted to the configured persistence store as 
specified by `PASS_CORE_FILE_SERVICE_TYPE`. 

If using `FILE_SYSTEM` as the persistence store, `PASS_CORE_FILE_SERVICE_ROOT_DIR` is also the root directory for file 
persistence. The value for the `PASS_CORE_FILE_SERVICE_ROOT_DIR` cannot be a S3 bucket, and it must be a valid path on 
the local filesystem.

The following environment variables are available for configuring the service:

* `PASS_CORE_FILE_SERVICE_TYPE=FILE_SYSTEM`
  * Currently supports [`FILE_SYSTEM` | `S3`]
* `PASS_CORE_FILE_SERVICE_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/root/dir`
  * The root directory of the service that is used to support file uploads and downloads and the root directory 
    for file persistence if using `FILE_SYSTEM` as the persistence store.
  * Default example: system_tmp/17318424270250529523
* `PASS_CORE_S3_BUCKET_NAME=bucket-test-name`
  * The name of the S3 bucket to use for file persistence if using S3 as the persistence store.
* `PASS_CORE_S3_REPO_PREFIX=s3-repo-prefix`
* `PASS_CORE_S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9090`
  * If using a custom endpoint for S3, this value should be set to the endpoint URL.

## HTTP Error Responses
The service will return the following HTTP error responses:
* 400 - Bad Request
  * This error is returned when a file is empty or missing. It will also handle exceptions that are thrown by the OCFL
    library. 
* 404 - Not Found
  * This is returned when performing a GET/DELETE and the fileId is invalid
* 500 - Internal Server Error
  * This error is returned when an unexpected error occurs in the service.

## Usage Examples

### Upload a file

```shell
curl -u BACKEND_USER:BACKEND_PASS -H "X-XSRF-TOKEN:token" -H "Cookie:XSRF-TOKEN=token" -X POST "http://localhost:8080/file" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=@/path/to/file"
```

### Download a file

```shell
curl -u BACKEND_USER:BACKEND_PASS -X GET "http://localhost:8080/file/{uuid}/{origFileName}" -H "accept: application/octet-stream" --output /path/to/file" 
```

### Delete a file

```shell
curl -u BACKEND_USER:BACKEND_PASS -H "X-XSRF-TOKEN:token" -H "Cookie:XSRF-TOKEN=token" -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/file/{fileId}/{origFileName}" -H "accept: application/json"
```
